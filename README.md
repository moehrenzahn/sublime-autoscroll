# Autoscroll

This plugin is a very simple implementation of typewriter scrolling for Sublime Text (tested with Sublime Text 3). When entering text, the active line will always stay in the middle of the editor window.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from here: <https://github.com/>
2. Extract it in your Packages folder (You can find out its location by clicking the `Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦` menu inside Sublime Text).

## Usage

The typewriter modes are controlled by the `auto_scroll` setting. Setting it to `true` (default) enables automatic typewriter scrolling.
